We struggled a lot with the update endpoint, and at the end of the day, a SEIR helped us figure it out. We kept getting errors all day before that. We are the only ones using Mongo in the class as far as I know, or at least one of the very few.

We split up in groups to work on endpoints. Each pair got two endpoints to work respectively. I'm still confused by the code but we managed to make it work by cobbling together screenshots from instructors...

We finally got our first create_event endpoint to work, we worked all together to debug and make it happen. Turns out, we didn't even define an event variable so we were trying to return something that didn't exist. We used examples from the instructors to guide us (like the books example) and I still don't totally understand FastAPI at all really. An ah-ha moment was, of course, we have to create an event object first, duh.
