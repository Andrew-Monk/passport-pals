We finally got our first create_event endpoint to work, we worked all together to debug and make it happen. Turns out, we didn't even define an event variable so we were trying to return something that didn't exist. We used examples from the instructors to guide us (like the books example) and I still don't totally understand FastAPI at all really. An ah-ha moment was, of course, we have to create an event object first, duh.
