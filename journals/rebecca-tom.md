## Friday, June 2nd

We are struggling still, none of the instructors, SEIRS, or fellow students have been able to help us/know what to do. Our backend and frontend work independently from eachother but not together.

## Thursday, June 1st

We are struggling getting the host event form to work, it's sending an event to the database but I'm not sure if its actually adding event to the logged in user/account, and were getting errors in the console. This all happened we pushed btw.

## Wednesday, May 31st

We continued to add multiple features/components/forms that are needed and attempted to add protected routes on the front end. But we might need to change that because routes shouldn't be protected on the front-end.

## Tuesday, May 30th

We added a bunch of multiple/features/components/forms by splitting off into pairs and working on it together. Andrew and I worked on trying to think about how to add protected routes.

We wrote our delete endpoint and finally started working on the frontend. We tried to figure out how to install react-router-dom and ended up in a whole mess.

## Monday, May 22nd

We struggled a lot with the update endpoint, and at the end of the day, a SEIR helped us figure it out. We kept getting errors all day before that. We are the only ones using Mongo in the class as far as I know, or at least one of the very few.

## Thursday, May 18th

We split up in groups to work on endpoints. Each pair got two endpoints to work respectively. I'm still confused by the code but we managed to make it work by cobbling together screenshots from instructors...

## Wednesday, May 17th

We finally got our first create_event endpoint to work, we worked all together to debug and make it happen. Turns out, we didn't even define an event variable so we were trying to return something that didn't exist. We used examples from the instructors to guide us (like the books example) and I still don't totally understand FastAPI at all really. An ah-ha moment was, of course, we have to create an event object first, duh.
