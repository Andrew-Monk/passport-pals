Today, I worked on:

* Adding the List of Events page, and Create an Event form

We split in to pairs to divide and conquer. My partner and I
were able to get the List of Events page done pretty easily
as it was similar to the code we did yesterday. We ran into
issues for the Create an Event form and after a lot of
troubleshooting we decided deleting and rebuilding containers
might be best.

We were also able to add a feature to the main page that shows
only 3 random events.

Today, I worked on:

* Adding the "delete event" codes, and started
front-end

Our group added the delete event code before lunch and
got it to work pretty easily. After that we decided
we were at the point where we wanted to start working
on the front end to see how our code was working and
if we needed to eventually change it somehow or highlight
if we were missing anything.

Front-end stuff started out slow, but eventually we were
able to pull a list of events for the home page and also
set up a nav bar. We will focus on beautification later.

Today, I worked on:

* Adding the "update event" codes

Our group started working on the update event function
thinking it would be easy but it was not. We tried to
make our own code because we had nothing to reference
but it was weird because we would get it to update but
simultaneously give us an error.

Eventually we had to get help from a SEIR who also couldnt
figure out how to fix our code so instead gave us a good
reference code that we could use to guide us. After
that the code worked fine!

Today, I worked on:

* Adding the "list events" codes

Our group split into pairs so that we could tackle
two functionalities in one afternoon. Rebecca and I
worked on the "list events" code. We added code to
the queries file, models file, and routers file.

When we went to Swagger we got it to return an empty
list but when we went to add a test event we had an
ID error, we added some extra code to our queries
and it was fixed.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up our first fast api codes

As a group, we worked through our first codes to
ensure we all knew what we were doing. We created
our "create event" fast apis. We started by writing
the event in and event out models, then we added the
queries code, the routers code, and finally the code
to main.py.

We went over to Swagger to test it out and got several
errors. Eventually we realized we were missing part of
our routers code and as soon as we added that it was
working!
