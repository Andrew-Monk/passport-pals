Today, I worked on:

* Adding the "list events" codes

Our group split into pairs so that we could tackle
two functionalities in one afternoon. Rebecca and I
worked on the "list events" code. We added code to
the queries file, models file, and routers file.

When we went to Swagger we got it to return an empty
list but when we went to add a test event we had an
ID error, we added some extra code to our queries
and it was fixed.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up our first fast api codes

As a group, we worked through our first codes to
ensure we all knew what we were doing. We created
our "create event" fast apis. We started by writing
the event in and event out models, then we added the
queries code, the routers code, and finally the code
to main.py.

We went over to Swagger to test it out and got several
errors. Eventually we realized we were missing part of
our routers code and as soon as we added that it was
working!
